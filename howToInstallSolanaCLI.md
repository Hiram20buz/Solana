If you want to add the specified PATH to your macOS environment permanently, you should add it to your shell profile configuration file. 

Assuming you are using the default shell on macOS, which is usually the Bash shell, you can add this line to your `~/.bash_profile` file. Here's how you can do it using a terminal:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Use a text editor like `nano` or `vi` to edit your `~/.bash_profile`. For example, to edit it with `nano`, you can run:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```

3. Add the following line to the file:

   ```bash
   PATH="/Users/rxs0523/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor. In `nano`, you can press `Ctrl + O`, then Enter to save, and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

5. After saving the file, you'll need to apply the changes to your current terminal session. You can do this by running:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

This will update your PATH environment variable, and the changes will take effect in your current terminal session.

Please note that if you're using a different shell, like Zsh, the configuration file to edit might be `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile`. Be sure to use the appropriate file for your shell.


## For example
echo $SHELL

nano ~/.zshrc  or nano ~/.bash_profile

export PATH="/Users/rxs0523/.local/share/solana/install/active_release/bin:$PATH"
